Induced only from previous completed L4 episodes in this prequential run.
The current case label is never available before prediction.

## Label Evidence From Prior L4 Episodes
- low: support_count=8; recent_cues=MAP min=74.0 mmHg is above the SOFA cardiovascular threshold (MAP <70 *despite vasopressors* or <65 without), and no other organ meets SOFA ≥2 criteria — 'low' severity requires ze | MAP min=60.0 mmHg alone does not satisfy SOFA cardiovascular criterion without evidence of vasopressor use or hypotension-induced organ hypoperfusion; verified 'low' severity requi | SOFA-based severity requires strict concurrent threshold violation across organ domains; isolated borderline values (e.g., platelet drop <30%, urine mean near but not sustained bel

## Recurrent Confusion Pairs
- high -> moderate: 5
- high -> low: 4
- moderate -> low: 2
- low -> high: 1

## Use Rule
Use this SOP as a checking guide. It must not override current visible clinical evidence.
